## Current Interests
I am passionate about understanding artificial intelligence and using it to solve hard problems. My current interests are in the applications of deep learning to better understanding large genomic datasets. For example, large language models such as GPT-2 from OpenAI have been shown to generalize very well to other tasks besides language. These transformer-based architectures have shown promise in many domains so how would well would it work it the context of genomic analysis? Outside of genomics I am interested in deep learning itself such as neural network training dynamics. Outside of working in this incredible field I enjoy surfing and playing chess.
