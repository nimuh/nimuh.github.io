I am a PhD student at Oregon State University studying Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. I have worked on a variety of different projects ranging from speeding up graph computations for social network analysis to building deep learning models to classify cancer from genotypes of individuals. This website is meant to be a location for writing about my research and other projects.
